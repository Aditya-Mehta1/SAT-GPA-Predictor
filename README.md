# SAT-GPA-Predictor
The SAT-GPA predictor is my first server-client based programme. 
It uses a RandomForestClassifier to make a prediction based on a person's SAT and GPA scores wheter they would have a chance at a given university. 
While I was able to reach a fairly accurate model, I could not upload the data it was trained on as it was not open-source, and privately collected by me.
